with optional Rock Ridge attributes.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>mkisofs</b></i>
is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate an
ISO-9660/JOLIET/HFS/UDF hybrid filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ISO-9660/JOLIET/UDF
filesystems are limited to a maximum size of 8&nbsp;TB. The
maximum size of a single file is 8&nbsp;TB (single files in
UDF are currently limited to aprox. 200&nbsp;GB). If you
like to have files larger than 2 GB, you need to specify
<b>&minus;iso&minus;level 3</b> or above. If a HFS hybrid is
created, the maximum file size for files in the HFS hybrid
is 2&nbsp;GB in any case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Hybrid
filesystem support <br>
mkisofs</b> is capable of generating the <b>System Use
Sharing Protocol records (SUSP)</b> specified by the <b>Rock
Ridge Interchange Protocol.</b> This is used to further
describe the files in the ISO-9660 filesystem to a UNIX
host, and provides information such as longer filenames,
uid/gid, posix permissions, symbolic links, hard links,
block and character devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If Joliet, HFS
or UDF hybrid command line options are specified,
<b>mkisofs</b> will create additional separate filesystem
meta data for Joliet, HFS or UDF. The file content in this
case refers to the same data blocks on the media. It will
generate a pure ISO-9660 filesystem unless the Joliet, HFS
or UDF hybrid command line options are given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mkisofs</b>
can generate a <i>true</i> (or <i>shared</i>) HFS hybrid
filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when
accessed from a Macintosh and as ISO-9660 files when
accessed from other machines. HFS stands for <i>Hierarchical
File System</i> and is the native file system used on
Macintosh computers up to Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;9.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an
alternative, <b>mkisofs</b> can generate the <i>Apple
Extensions to ISO-9660</i> or <i>UDF</i> for each file.
These extensions provide each file with CREATOR, TYPE and
certain Finder Flags when accessed from a Macintosh. See the
<b>HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS</b> section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Functional
description <br>
mkisofs</b> takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and
generates a binary image which will correspond to an
ISO-9660 or Joliet/HFS/UDF filesystem when written to a
block device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each file
written to the ISO-9660 filesystem must have a filename in
the 8.3 format (8 characters, period, 3 characters, all
upper case), even if Rock Ridge attributes are in use. This
filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of
the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each
filename in each directory must be different from the other
filenames in the same directory. <b>mkisofs</b> generally
tries to form correct names by forcing the UNIX filename to
upper case and truncating as required, but often times this
yields unsatisfactory results when there are cases where the
truncated names are not all unique. <b>mkisofs</b> assigns
weightings to each filename, and if two names that are
otherwise the same are found the name with the lower
priority is renamed to have a 3 digit number as an extension
(where the number is guaranteed to be unique). An example of
this would be the files foo.bar and foo.bar.~1~ - the file
foo.bar.~1~ would be written as FOO000.BAR;1 and the file
foo.bar would be written as FOO.BAR;1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
various HFS or UDF options, <b>mkisofs</b> will attempt to
recognise files stored in a number of Apple/Unix file
formats and will copy the data and resource forks as well as
any relevant finder information. See the <b>HFS MACINTOSH
FILE FORMATS</b> section below for more about formats
<b>mkisofs</b> supports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>mkisofs</b> is not designed to communicate with writers
for optical media directly. Most writers have proprietary
command sets which vary from one manufacturer to another,
and you need a specialized tool like <b>cdrecord</b> to
actually burn the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>cdrecord</b> utility is a utility capable of burning an
actual disc. The latest version of <b>cdrecord</b> is
available from
<b>https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdrtools/files/</b> or
<b>https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdrtools/files/alpha/</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also you should
know that most CD writers are very particular about timing.
Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot let their buffer
empty before you are done, or you will end up with a corrupt
disc. Thus it is critical that you be able to maintain an
uninterrupted data stream to the writer for the entire time
that the disc is being written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dealing with
path names <br>
pathspec</b> is the path of the directory tree to be copied
into the ISO-9660 filesystem. Multiple paths can be
specified, and <b>mkisofs</b> will merge the files found in
all of the specified path components to form the cdrom
image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the option
<b>&minus;graft&minus;points</b> has been specified, it is
possible to graft the paths at points other than the root
directory, and it is possible to graft files or directories
onto the cdrom image with names different than what they
have in the source filesystem. This is easiest to illustrate
with a couple of examples. Let&rsquo;s start by assuming
that a local file ../old.lis exists, and you wish to include
it in the cdrom image.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>foo/bar/=../old.lis</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will include
the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/old.lis,
while</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p>foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will include
the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/xxx. The
same sort of syntax can be used with directories as well.
<b>mkisofs</b> will create any directories required such
that the graft points exist on the cdrom image - the
directories do not need to appear in one of the paths. By
default, any directories that are created on the fly like
this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by
the person running mkisofs. If you wish other permissions or
owners of the intermediate directories, see
<b>&minus;uid</b>, <b>&minus;gid</b>,
<b>&minus;dir&minus;mode</b>, <b>&minus;file&minus;mode</b>
and <b>&minus;new&minus;dir&minus;mode</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mkisofs</b>
will also run on Win9<i>x</i>/NT<i>x</i> machines when
compiled with Cygnus&rsquo; cygwin (available from
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/). Therefore most
references in this man page to <i>Unix</i> also apply to
<i>Win32</i> or <i>Win64</i>.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;abstract</b>
<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the abstract file
name in the primary volume descriptor. There is space on the
disc for 37 characters of information. The related Joliet
entry is limited to 18 characters. This parameter can also
be set in the file <b>.mkisofsrc</b> with ABST=filename. If
specified in both places, the command line version is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">It is up to the
user of <b>mkisofs</b> to include a file with the apropriate
name in the created filesystem tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A</b>
<i>application_id</i> <b><br>
&minus;appid</b> <i>application_id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a text string that
will be written into the volume header. This should describe
the application that will be on the disc. There is space on
the disc for 128 characters of information. The related
Joliet entry is limited to 64 characters. This parameter can
also be set in the file <b>.mkisofsrc</b> with APPI=id. If
specified in both places, the command line version is
used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;allow&minus;leading&minus;dots</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This violates the ISO-9660
standard, but it happens to work on many systems. Use with
caution.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;allow&minus;lowercase</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This options allows lower case
characters to appear in ISO-9660 filenames. <br>
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work
on some systems. Use with caution.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;allow&minus;multidot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This options allows more than
one dot to appear in ISO-9660 filenames. A leading dot is
not affected by this option, it may be allowed separately
using the <b>&minus;allow&minus;leading&minus;dots</b>
option. <br>
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work
on many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;biblio</b>
<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the bibliographic
file name in the primary volume descriptor. There is space
on the disc for 37 characters of information. The related
Joliet entry is limited to 18 characters. This parameter can
also be set in the file <b>.mkisofsrc</b> with
BIBLO=filename. If specified in both places, the command
line version is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">It is up to the
user of <b>mkisofs</b> to include a file with the apropriate
name in the created filesystem tree.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cache inode and device numbers
to find hard links to files. If <b>mkisofs</b> finds a hard
link (a file with multiple names), then the file will only
appear once on the CD. This helps to save space on the CD.
The option <b>&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b> is default on
UNIX like operating systems. Be careful when using this
option on a filesystem without unique inode numbers as it
may result in files containing the wrong content on CD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If inodes are
not cached, <b>mkisofs</b> will revert to the old Rrip
Version-1.10 (see <b>&minus;rrip110</b>) and <b>mkisofs</b>
will not be able to create <b>correct inode numbers</b> for
zero sized files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;no&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not cache inode and device
numbers. This option is needed whenever a filesystem does
not have unique inode numbers. It is the default on old
<b>Cygwin</b> versions. As the Microsoft operating system
that runs below <b>Cygwin</b> uses 64 bit inode numbers for
NTFS, it does not have unique inode numbers in the 32 bit
range. Old Cygwin versions create fake 32-bit inode numbers
from a hash algorithm and thus create non-unique numbers. If
<b>mkisofs</b> would cache inodes on old Cygwin versions, it
would believe that some files are identical although they
are not. The result in this case are files that contain the
wrong content if a significant amount of different files
(&gt; ~5000) is in inside the tree that is to be archived.
This does not happen when the
<b>&minus;no&minus;cache&minus;inodes</b> is used, but the
disadvantage is that <b>mkisofs</b> cannot detect hardlinks
anymore and the resulting CD image may be larger than
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If inodes are
not cached, <b>mkisofs</b> will revert to the old Rrip
Version-1.10 (see <b>&minus;rrip110</b>) and <b>mkisofs</b>
will not be able to create <b>correct inode numbers</b> for
zero sized files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;b</b>
<i>eltorito_boot_image</i> <b><br>
&minus;eltorito&minus;boot</b>
<i>eltorito_boot_image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the path and filename
of the boot image to be used when making an &quot;El
Torito&quot; bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to
the source path and inside the source tree specified to
<b>mkisofs.</b> This option is required to make an &quot;El
Torito&quot; bootable CD. The boot image must be exactly the
size of either a 1200, 1440, or a 2880 kB floppy, and
<b>mkisofs</b> will use this size when creating the output
ISO-9660 filesystem. It is assumed that the first 512 byte
sector should be read from the boot image (it is essentially
emulating a normal floppy drive). This will work, for
example, if the boot image is a boot floppy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the boot
image is not an image of a floppy, you need to add one of
the options: <b>&minus;hard&minus;disk&minus;boot</b> or
<b>&minus;no&minus;emul&minus;boot</b>. If the system should
not boot off the emulated disk, use
<b>&minus;no&minus;boot</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">More than one
boot entry may be specified, see
<b>&minus;eltorito&minus;platform</b> and
<b>&minus;eltorito&minus;alt&minus;boot</b> on how to
specify more boot entries. The first boot entry is the
<b>default boot entry</b>. Additional boot entries are
members for a multi boot configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>&minus;sort</b> option has not been specified, the boot
images are sorted with low priority (+2) to the beginning of
the medium. If you don&rsquo;t like this, you need to
specify a sort weight of 0 for the boot images.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;eltorito&minus;alt&minus;boot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Start with a new set of
&quot;El Torito&quot; boot parameters. This allows to have
more than one El Torito boot entry on a CD. A maximum of 63
El Torito boot entries may be put on a single CD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;eltorito&minus;alt&minus;boot</b> option starts a
new boot entry with the same <i>platform id</i> but no new
boot section except when it appears past the first boot
entry which is the default boot entry.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;eltorito&minus;platform</b>
<i>id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the &quot;El Torito&quot;
platform id for a boot record or a section of boot records.
The. <i>id</i> parameter may be either:</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the option
<b>&minus;eltorito&minus;platform</b> appears before the
first <b>&minus;eltorito&minus;boot</b> option, it sets the
<i>platform id</i> for the default boot entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the option
<b>&minus;eltorito&minus;platform</b> appears after an
<b>&minus;eltorito&minus;boot</b> option and sets the
<i>platform id</i> to a value different from the previous
value, it starts a new set of boot entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The second boot
entry and any new <i>platform id</i> creates a new section
header and reduces the number of boot entries per CD by
one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>errctl=</b> <i>name</i>
<b><br>
errctl=</b> <i>error control spec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add the content from file
<i>name</i> to the error control definitions or add <i>error
control spec</i> to the error control definitions. More than
one error control file and more than one <i>error control
spec</i> as well as a mixture of both forms is possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
using error control is to make <b>mkisofs</b> quiet about
error conditions that are known to be irrelevant on the
quality of the created filesystem or to tell <b>mkisofs</b>
to abort on certain error conditions instead of trying to
continue with the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A typical
reason to use error control is to suppress warnings about
growing log files while doing a backup on a live file
system. Another typical reason to use error control is to
tell <b>mkisofs</b> to abort if e.g. a file could not be
archived instead of continuing to archive other files from a
list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The error
control file contains a set of lines, each starting with a
list of error conditions to be ignored followed by white
space followed by a file name pattern (see <b>match</b>(1)
or <b>patmatch</b>(3) for more information). The <i>error
control spec</i> uses the same syntax as a single line from
the error control file. If the file name pattern needs to
start with white space, use a backslash to escape the start
of the file name. It is not possible to have new line
characters in the file name pattern. Whenever an error
situation is encountered, <b>mkisofs</b> checks the lines in
the error control file starting from the top. If the current
error condition is listed on a line in the error control
file, then <b>mkisofs</b> checks whether the pattern on the
rest of the line matches the current file name. If this is
the case, <b>mkisofs</b> uses the current error control
specification to control the current error condition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The list of
error conditions to be handled may use one or more (in this
case separated by a &rsquo;|&rsquo; character) identifiers
from the list below:</p>

<td width="60%">


<p>If this meta condition is included in an error
condition, <b>mkisofs</b> aborts (exits) as soon as possible
after this error condition has been seen instead of making
<b>mkisofs</b> quiet about the condition. This error
condition flag may only be used together with at another

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;hide&minus;joliet</b>
<i>glob</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Hide <i>glob</i> from being
seen on the Joliet directory. <i>glob</i> is a shell
wild-card-style pattern that must match any part of the
filename or path. Multiple globs may be hidden. If
<i>glob</i> matches a directory, then the contents of that
directory will be hidden. In order to match a directory
name, make sure the pathname does not include a trailing
&rsquo;/&rsquo; character. All the hidden files will still
be written to the output CD image file. Should be used with

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rename the directory
<b>RR_MOVED</b> to <b>.rr_moved</b> in the Rock Ridge tree.
This option has been introduced when <b>mkisofs</b> was not
able to hide the directory in the Rock Ridge tree. This
version of <b>mkisofs</b> always automatically hides the
<b>RR_MOVED</b> directory in the Rock Ridge tree. If you
need to have no <b>RR_MOVED</b> directory at all (even in
the ISO-9660 tree), you should use the <b>&minus;D</b>
option. Note that in case that the <b>&minus;D</b> option
has been specified, the resulting filesystem is not ISO-9660

defines the characters used in local file names. To get a
list of valid charset names, call <b>mkisofs
&minus;input&minus;charset help.</b> To get a 1:1 mapping,
you may use <b>default</b> as charset name. If the input
charset has not been set up from the locale in the
environment, the default initial values are <i>cp437</i> on
DOS based systems and <i>iso8859-1</i> on all other systems.
See <b>CHARACTER SETS</b> section below for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;input&minus;charset</b> has not been specified, it
will be set up from the locale in the environment. If you
like to disable this automatic setup, use the empty string
as locale name.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;output&minus;charset</b>
<i>charset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set up the output charset that

SETS</b> section below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;iso&minus;level</b>
<i>level</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the ISO-9660 conformance
level. Valid numbers are 1..3 and 4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With level 1,
files may only consist of one section and filenames are
restricted to 8.3 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With level 2,
files may only consist of one section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With level 3,
no restrictions (other than ISO-9660:1988) do apply.
Starting with this level, mkisofs also allows files to be
larger than 4 GB by implementing ISO-9660 multi-extent
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With all
ISO-9660 levels from 1..3, all filenames are restricted to
upper case letters, numbers and the underscore (_). The
maximum filename length is restricted to 31 characters, the
directory nesting level is restricted to 8 and the maximum
path length is limited to 255 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Level 4
officially does not exists but <b>mkisofs</b> maps it to
ISO-9660:1999 which is ISO-9660 version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With level 4,
an enhanced volume descriptor with version number and file
structure version number set to 2 is emitted. There may be
more than 8 levels of directory nesting, there is no need
for a file to contain a dot and the dot has no more special
meaning, file names do not have version numbers, the maximum
length for files and directory is raised to 207. If Rock
Ridge is used, the maximum ISO-9660 name length is reduced
to 197.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When creating
Version 2 images, <b>mkisofs</b> emits an enhanced volume
descriptor which looks similar to a primary volume
descriptor but is slightly different. Be careful not to use
broken software to make ISO-9660 images bootable by assuming
a second PVD copy and patching this putative PVD copy into
an El Torito VD.</p>

pattern that must match part of the filename (not the path
as with option <b>&minus;x</b>). Technically <i>glob</i> is
matched against the <i>d-&gt;d_name</i> part of the

Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">mkisofs
&minus;o rom &minus;m &rsquo;*.o&rsquo; &minus;m core
&minus;m foobar</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">would exclude

course all its descendants) would be excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The
<b>&minus;m</b> and <b>&minus;x</b> option description
should both be updated, they are wrong. Both now work

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;max&minus;iso9660&minus;filenames</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow 37 chars in ISO-9660

the extra name space is taken from the space reserved for
ISO-9660 version numbers. <br>
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work
on many systems. Although a conforming application needs to
provide a buffer space of at least 37 characters, disks
created with this option may cause a buffer overflow in the
reading operating system. Use with extreme care.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;dev</b>
<i>device</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies path to existing
ISO-9660 image to be merged. The alternate form takes a SCSI
device specifier that uses the same syntax as the
<b>dev=</b> parameter of <b>cdrecord.</b> The output of
<b>mkisofs</b> will be a new session which should get
written to the end of the image specified in &minus;M.
Typically this requires multi-session capability for the

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;modification&minus;date</b>
<i>date-spec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the <b>modification

different from the current time. This allows e.g. to set up
an intentional UUID for <b>grub</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The format of

<b>GMT offset in hours and minutes</b>. The time is
interpreted as local time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Year and the
GMT offset are four digit fields, all other fields take two
digits. The GMT offset may be between -12 and +13 hours in
15 minute steps. Locations east to Greenwich have positive
values. The value is the sum of the time zone offset and the
effects from daylight saving time. Omited values are
replaced by the minimal possible values. If the GMT offset
is omited, it is computed from the local time value that has
been supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Between year
and month as well as between month and day of month, a
separator chosen from &rsquo;/&rsquo; and &rsquo;-&rsquo;
may appear. In this case, the year may be a two digit number
with values 69..99 representing 1969..1999 and values 00..68
representing 2000..2068. Between date and time spec, an
optional space is permitted. Between hours and minutes as
well as between minutes and seconds, an optional
&rsquo;:&rsquo; separator is permitted. This allows
<b>mkisofs</b> to parse the popular POSIX date format
created by:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rational&minus;rock</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is like the &minus;R
option, but file ownership and modes are set to more useful
values. The uid and gid are set to zero, because they are
usually only useful on the author&rsquo;s system, and not
useful to the client. All the file read bits are set true,
so that files and directories are globally readable on the
client. If any execute bit is set for a file, set all of the
execute bits, so that executables are globally executable on
the client. If any search bit is set for a directory, set
all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client. All write bits are cleared,
because the CD-Rom will be mounted read-only in any case. If
any of the special mode bits are set, clear them, because
file locks are not useful on a read-only file system, and
set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or gid 0. When used
on Win32, the execute bit is set on <i>all</i> files. This
is a result of the lack of file permissions on Win32 and the
Cygwin POSIX emulation layer. See also &minus;uid
&minus;gid, &minus;dir&minus;mode, &minus;file&minus;mode
and &minus;new&minus;dir&minus;mode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;relaxed&minus;filenames</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The option
<b>&minus;relaxed&minus;filenames</b> allows ISO-9660
filenames to include digits, upper case characters and all
other 7 bit ASCII characters (resp. anything except
lowercase characters). <br>
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work
on many systems. Use with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;root</b>
<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Moves all files and directories
into <i>dir</i> in the image. This is essentially the same
as using <b>-graft-points</b> and adding <i>dir</i> in front
of every pathspec, but is easier to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>dir</i> may
actually be several levels deep. It is created with the same
permissions as other graft points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rrip110</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create ISO-9660 file system
images that follow the old Rrip Version-1.10 standard from
1993. This option may be needed if you know of systems that
do not implement the Rrip protocol correctly and like the
file system to be read by such a system. Currently no such
system is known.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a file
system has been created with <b>&minus;rrip110</b>, the Rock
Ridge attributes do not include inode number
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rrip112</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create ISO-9660 file system
images that follow the new Rrip Version-1.12 standard from
1994, this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;old-root</b>
<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is necessary when
writing a multisession image and the previous (or even
older) session was written with <b>-root</b> <i>dir.</i>
Using a directory name not found in the previous session
causes <b>mkisofs</b> to abort with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option, <b>mkisofs</b> would not be able to find unmodified
files and would be forced to write their data into the image
once more.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;root</b>
and <b>&minus;old-root</b> are meant to be used together to
do incremental backups. The initial session would e.g. use:
<b>mkisofs &minus;root backup_1</b> <i>dirs.</i> The next
incremental backup with <b>mkisofs &minus;root backup_2
&minus;old-root backup_1</b> <i>dirs.</i> would take another
snapshot of these directories. The first snapshot would be
found in <b>backup_1</b>, the second one in <b>backup_2</b>,
but only modified or new files need to be written into the
second session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Without these
options, new files would be added and old ones would be
preserved. But old ones would be overwritten if the file was
modified. Recovering the files by copying the whole
directory back from CD would also restore files that were
deleted intentionally. Accessing several older versions of a
file requires support by the operating system to choose
which sessions are to be mounted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;short&minus;rr&minus;time</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the short ISO-9660 time
format for the file time stamps used in Rock Ridge. This
time format allows to represent year 1990 .. year 2155 with
a granularity of one second.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;sort</b> <i>sort
file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sort file locations on the
media. Sorting is controlled by a file that contains pairs
of filenames and sorting offset weighting. If the weighting
is higher, the file will be located closer to the beginning
of the media, if the weighting is lower, the file will be
located closer to the end of the media. There must be only
one space or tabs character between the filename and the
weight and the weight must be the last characters on a line.
The filename is taken to include all the characters up to,
but not including the last space or tab character on a line.
This is to allow for space characters to be in, or at the
end of a filename. This option does <b>not</b> sort the
order of the file names that appear in the ISO-9660
directory. It sorts the order in which the file data is
written to the CD image - which may be useful in order to
optimize the data layout on a CD. See README.sort for more
details.</p>

the Sun disk label that is created with the
<b>&minus;sparc-boot</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;split&minus;output</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Split the output image into
several files of approximately 1 GB. This helps to create
DVD sized ISO-9660 images on operating systems without large
file support. Cdrecord will concatenate more than one file
into a single track if writing to a DVD. To make
<b>&minus;split&minus;output</b> work, the <b>&minus;o</b>
<i>filename</i> option must be specified. The resulting
output images will be named:
<i>filename_00</i>,<i>filename_01,</i>filename_02<i>...</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;stream&minus;media&minus;size</b>
<i>#</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select streaming operation and
set the media size to # sectors. This allows you to pipe the
output of the tar program into mkisofs and to create a
ISO-9660 filesystem without the need of an intermediate tar
archive file. If this option has been specified,
<b>mkisofs</b> reads from <b>stdin</b> and creates a file
with the name <b>STREAM.IMG</b>. The maximum size of the
file (with padding) is 200 sectors less than the specified
media size. If <b>&minus;no&minus;pad</b> has been
specified, the file size is 50 sectors less than the
specified media size. If the file is smaller, then mkisofs
will write padding. This may take a while.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The option
<b>&minus;stream&minus;media&minus;size</b> creates simple
ISO-9660 filesystems only and may not used together with
multi-session or hybrid filesystem options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;stream&minus;file&minus;name</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the file name used with
<b>&minus;stream&minus;media&minus;size</b> <i>#</i> to a
value different from <b>STREAM.IMG</b>. If this option is
used, the filesystem is created as if
<b>&minus;iso&minus;level</b> 4 has been specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;sunx86&minus;boot</b>
<i>UFS-img,,,AUX1-img</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a comma separated
list of filesystem images that are needed to make a bootable
CD for Solaris x86 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
partition 1 is used for the ISO-9660 image and that
partition 2 is the whole disk, so partition 1 and 2 may not
be used by external partition data. The first image file is
mapped to partition 0. There may be empty fields in the
comma separated list, and list entries for partition 1 and 2
must be empty. The maximum number of supported partitions is
8 (although the Solaris x86 partition table could support up
to 16 partitions), so it is impossible to specify more than
6 partition images. This option is required to make a
bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>&minus;sunx86&minus;boot</b> option has been specified,
the first sector of the resulting image will contain a PC
fdisk label with a Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition that
starts at offset 512 and spans the whole CD. In addition,
for the Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition, there is a SVr4
disk label at offset 1024 in the first sector of the CD.
This disk label specifies slice 0 for the first (usually UFS
type) filesystem image that is used to boot the PC and slice
1 for the ISO-9660 image. Slice 2 spans the whole CD slice 3
... slice 7 may be used for additional filesystem images
that have been specified with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A Solaris x86
boot CD uses a 1024 byte sized primary boot that uses the
<b>El-Torito no-emulation</b> boot mode and a secondary
generic boot that is in CD sectors 1..15. For this reason,
both <b>-b</b> <i>bootimage</i>
<b>-no&minus;emul&minus;boot</b> and <b>&minus;G</b>

<h2>CHARACTER SETS
<a name="CHARACTER SETS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mkisofs</b>
processes file names in a POSIX compliant way as strings of
8-bit characters. To represent all codings for all
languages, 8-bit characters are not sufficient. Unicode or
<b>ISO-10646</b> define character codings that need at least
21 bits to represent all known languages. They may be
represented with <b>UTF-32</b>, <b>UTF-16</b> or
<b>UTF-8</b> coding. <b>UTF-32</b> uses a plain 32-bit
coding but seems to be uncommon. <b>UCS-2</b> is used by
Microsoft with Win32. This coding is similar to
<b>UTF-16</b> with the disadvantage that it only supports a
16 bit subset (except when surrogates are used) of all codes
and that 16-bit characters are not compliant with the POSIX
filesystem interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Modern UNIX
operating systems may use <b>UTF-8</b> coding for filenames.
This coding allows to use the complete Unicode code set.
Each 32-bit character is represented by one or more 8-bit
characters. If a character is coded in <b>ISO-8859-1</b>
(used in Central Europe and North America) it maps 1:1 to a
<b>UTF-32</b> or <b>UTF-16</b> coded Unicode character. If a
character is coded in <b>7-Bit ASCII</b> (used in USA and
other countries with limited character set) it maps 1:1 to a
<b>UTF-32</b>, <b>UTF-16</b> or <b>UTF-8</b> coded Unicode
character. Character codes that cannot be represented as a
single byte in UTF-8 (typically if the value is &gt; 0x7F)
use escape sequences that map to more than one 8-bit
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all
operating systems would use <b>UTF-8</b> coding,
<b>mkisofs</b> would not need to recode characters in file
names. Unfortunately, Apple uses completely nonstandard
codings and Microsoft uses a Unicode coding that is not
compatible with the POSIX filename interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For all non
<b>UTF-8</b> coded operating systems, the actual character
that each byte represents, depends on the <i>character
set</i> or <i>codepage</i> (which is the name used by
Microsoft) used by the local operating system in use - the
characters in a character set will reflect the region or
natural language used by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually
character codes 0x00-0x1f are control characters, codes
0x20-0x7f are the 7 bit ASCII characters and (on PC&rsquo;s
and Mac&rsquo;s) 0x80-0xff are used for other characters.
Unfortunately even this does not follow ISO standards that
reserve the range 0x80-0x9f for control characters and only
allow 0xa0-0xff for other characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As there is a
lot more than 256 characters/symbols in use, only a small
subset are represented in a character set. Therefore the
same character code may represent a different character in
different character sets. So a file name generated, say in
central Europe, may not display the same character when
viewed on a machine in, say eastern Europe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make matters
more complicated, different operating systems use different
character sets for the region or language. For example the
character code for &quot;small e with acute accent&quot; may
be character code 0x82 on a PC, code 0x8e on a Macintosh and
code 0xe9 on a UNIX system. Note while the codings used on a
PC or Mac are nonstandard, Unicode codes this character as
0x00000000e9 which is basically the same value as the value
used by most UNIX systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As long as not
all operating systems and applications will use the Unicode
character set as the basis for file names in a unique way,
it may be necessary to specify which character set your file
names use in and which character set the file names should
appear on the CD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are four
options to specify the character sets you want to use: <br>
&minus;input&minus;charset</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the local character set
you are using on your host machine. Any character set
conversions that take place will use this character set as
the staring point. The default input character sets are
<i>cp437</i> on DOS based systems and <i>iso8859-1</i> on
all other systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<i>&minus;J</i> option is given, then the Unicode
equivalents of the input character set will be used in the
Joliet directory. Using the <i>&minus;jcharset</i> option is
the same as using the <i>&minus;input&minus;charset</i> and
<i>&minus;J</i> options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;output&minus;charset</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the character set that
will be used with for the Rock Ridge names on the CD.
Defaults to the input character set. Only likely to be
useful if used on a non-Unix platform. e.g. using
<b>mkisofs</b> on a Microsoft Win32 machine to create Rock
Ridge CDs. If you are using <b>mkisofs</b> on a Unix
machine, it is likely that the output character set will be
the same as the input character set.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;input&minus;hfs&minus;charset</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the HFS character set
used for HFS file names decoded from any of the various
Apple/Unix file formats. Only useful when used with
<i>&minus;mac&minus;name</i> option. See the <b>HFS
MACINTOSH FILE NAMES</b> for more information. Defaults to
<i>cp10000</i> (Mac Roman).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;output&minus;hfs&minus;charset</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Defines the HFS character set
used to create HFS file names from the input character set
in use. In most cases this will be from the character set
given with the <i>&minus;input&minus;charset</i> option.
Defaults to the input HFS character set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>default</b> character set is built into <b>mkisofs</b>. A
number of further character sets are read in from the
filesystem by <i>mkisofs</i> from a directory relatively to
the install path. To get a listing, use <b>mkisofs
&minus;input&minus;charset help.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additional
character sets from <b>iconv</b>(1) may be used on systems,
that support <b>iconv</b>(1). In this case, call <b>iconv
&minus;l</b> to get a list of valid character sets from this
coding method. To force an <b>iconv</b>(1) based coding, use
<b>iconv:</b><i>name</i> instead of <i>name</i> for the
character set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If using non
<b>iconv</b>(1) based character sets, additional character
sets can be read from file for any of the character set
options by giving a filename as the argument to the options.
A given character set will be read from a file whenever the
supplied name contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the character set files is the same as the mapping files
available from http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS The
format of these files is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Column #1 is
the input byte code (in hex as 0xXX) <br>
Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX) <br>
Rest of the line is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any blank line,
line without two (or more) columns in the above format or
comments lines (starting with the # character) are ignored
without any warnings. Any missing input code is mapped to
Unicode character 0x0000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
is no support for 16 bit UNICODE (UTF-16) or 32 bit UNICODE
(UTF-32) coding because this coding is not POSIX compliant.
There should be support for UTF-8 UNICODE coding which is
compatible to POSIX filenames and supported by moder UNIX
implementations such as Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A 1:1 character
set mapping can be defined by using the keyword
<i>default</i> as the argument to any of the character set
options. This is the behaviour of older (v1.12) versions of
<b>mkisofs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ISO-9660
file names generated from the input filenames are not
converted from the input character set. The ISO-9660
character set is a very limited subset of the ASCII
characters, so any conversion would be pointless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any character
that <b>mkisofs</b> can not convert will be replaced with a
&rsquo;_&rsquo; character.</p>

<h2>HFS CREATOR/TYPE
<a name="HFS CREATOR/TYPE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Macintosh
file has two properties associated with it which define
which application created the file, the <i>CREATOR</i> and
what data the file contains, the <i>TYPE</i>. Both are
(exactly) 4 letter strings. Usually this allows a Macintosh
user to double-click on a file and launch the correct
application etc. The CREATOR and TYPE of a particular file
can be found by using something like ResEdit (or similar) on
a Macintosh.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The CREATOR and
TYPE information is stored in all the various Apple/Unix
encoded files. For other files it is possible to base the
CREATOR and TYPE on the filename&rsquo;s extension using a
<i>mapping</i> file (the <b>&minus;map</b> option) and/or
using the <i>magic number</i> (usually a <i>signature</i> in
the first few bytes) of a file (the <b>&minus;magic</b>
option). If both these options are given, then their order
on the command line is important. If the <b>&minus;map</b>
option is given first, then a filename extension match is
attempted before a magic number match. However, if the
<b>&minus;magic</b> option is given first, then a magic
number match is attempted before a filename extension
match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a mapping or
magic file is not used, or no match is found then the
default CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files can be set by
using entries in the <b>.mkisofsrc</b> file or using the
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;creator</b> and/or
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;type</b> options, otherwise the default
CREATOR and TYPE are &rsquo;unix&rsquo; and
&rsquo;TEXT&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the <i>mapping</i> file is the same <i>afpfile</i> format as
used by <i>aufs</i>. This file has five columns for the
<i>extension</i>, <i>file translation</i>, <i>CREATOR</i>,
<i>TYPE</i> and <i>Comment</i>. Lines starting with the
&rsquo;#&rsquo; character are comment lines and are ignored.
An example file would be like:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-17041.png" alt="Image grohtml-17041.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The first
column <i>EXTN</i> defines the Unix filename extension to be
mapped. The default mapping for any filename extension that
doesn&rsquo;t match is defined with the &quot;*&quot;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>Xlate</i> column defines the type of text translation
between the Unix and Macintosh file it is ignored by
<b>mkisofs</b>, but is kept to be compatible with
<b>aufs</b>(1). Although <b>mkisofs</b> does not alter the
contents of a file, if a binary file has its TYPE set as
&rsquo;TEXT&rsquo;, it <i>may</i> be read incorrectly on a
Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the default TYPE
may be &rsquo;????&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>CREATOR</i> and <i>TYPE</i> keywords must be 4 characters
long and enclosed in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The comment
field is enclosed in double quotes - it is ignored by
<b>mkisofs</b>, but is kept to be compatible with
<b>aufs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the <i>magic</i> file is almost identical to the
<b>magic</b>(4) file used by the Linux <b>file</b>(1)
command - the routines for reading and decoding the
<i>magic</i> file are based on the Linux <b>file</b>(1)
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This file has
four tab separated columns for the <i>byte offset</i>,
<i>type</i>, <i>test</i> and <i>message</i>. Lines starting
with the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character are comment lines and are
ignored. An example file would be like:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-17042.png" alt="Image grohtml-17042.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the file is described in the <b>magic</b>(4) man page. The
only difference here is that for each entry in the magic
file, the <i>message</i> for the initial offset <b>must</b>
be 4 characters for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters for
the TYPE - white space is optional between them. Any other
characters on this line are ignored. Continuation lines
(starting with a &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;) are also ignored i.e.
only the initial offset lines are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using the
<b>&minus;magic</b> option may significantly increase
processing time as each file has to opened and read to find
its magic number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In summary, for
all files, the default CREATOR is &rsquo;unix&rsquo; and the
default TYPE is &rsquo;TEXT&rsquo;. These can be changed by
using entries in the <i>.mkisofsrc</i> file or by using the
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;creator</b> and/or
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;type</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the a file
is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats (and the format
has been selected), then the CREATOR and TYPE are taken from
the values stored in the Apple/Unix file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other files can
have their CREATOR and TYPE set from their file name
extension (the <b>&minus;map</b> option), or their magic
number (the <b>&minus;magic</b> option). If the default
match is used in the <i>mapping</i> file, then these values
override the default CREATOR and TYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A full
CREATOR/TYPE database can be found at

<h2>HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
<a name="HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Macintosh files
have two parts called the <i>Data</i> and <i>Resource</i>
fork. Either may be empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can
only cope with files having one part (or fork). To add to
this, Macintosh files have a number of attributes associated
with them - probably the most important are the TYPE and
CREATOR. Again Unix has no concept of these types of
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">e.g. a
Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the image is stored
in the Data fork and a desktop thumbnail stored in the
Resource fork. It is usually the information in the data
fork that is useful across platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore to
store a Macintosh file on a Unix filesystem, a way has to be
found to cope with the two forks and the extra attributes
(which are referred to as the <i>finder info</i>).
Unfortunately, it seems that every software package that
stores Macintosh files on Unix has chosen a completely
different storage method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Apple/Unix
formats that <i>mkisofs</i> (partially) supports are: <br>
CAP AUFS format</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork in subdirectory .resource with same filename
as data fork. Finder info in .finderinfo subdirectory with
same filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">AppleDouble/Netatalk</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork stored in a file with same name prefixed with
&quot;%&quot;. Finder info also stored in same &quot;%&quot;
file. Netatalk uses the same format, but the resource
fork/finderinfo stored in subdirectory .AppleDouble with
same name as data fork.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">AppleSingle</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data structures similar to
above, except both forks and finder info are stored in one
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Helios EtherShare</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork and finder info together in subdirectory .rsrc
with same filename as data fork.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">IPT UShare</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Very similar to the EtherShare
format, but the finder info is stored slightly
differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MacBinary</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Both forks and finder info
stored in one file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Apple PC Exchange</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used by Macintoshes to store
Apple files on DOS (FAT) disks. Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork in subdirectory resource.frk (or
RESOURCE.FRK). Finder info as one record in file finder.dat
(or FINDER.DAT). Separate finder.dat for each data fork
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note:
<i>mkisofs</i> needs to know the native FAT cluster size of
the disk that the PC Exchange files are on (or have been
copied from). This size is given by the
<b>&minus;cluster&minus;size</b> option. The cluster or
allocation size can be found by using the DOS utility
<b>CHKDSK</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">May not work
with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS
8.1). DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be
mounted as type <b>msdos</b> (not <b>vfat</b>) when using
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SGI/XINET</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used by SGI machines when they
mount HFS disks. Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork
in subdirectory .HSResource with same name. Finder info as
one record in file .HSancillary. Separate .HSancillary for
each data fork directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Thursby Software Systems
DAVE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows Macintoshes to store
Apple files on SMB servers. Data fork stored in a file.
Resource fork in subdirectory resource.frk. Uses the
AppleDouble format to store resource fork.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Services for Macintosh</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Format of files stored by NT
Servers on NTFS filesystems. Data fork is stored as
&quot;filename&quot;. Resource fork stored as a NTFS
<i>stream</i> called &quot;filename:AFP_Resource&quot;. The
finder info is stored as a NTFS <i>stream</i> called
&quot;filename:Afp_AfpInfo&quot;. These streams are normally
invisible to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Warning:
mkisofs only partially supports the SFM format. If an HFS
file or folder stored on the NT server contains an
<i>illegal</i> NT character in its name, then NT converts
these characters to <i>Private Use Unicode</i> characters.
The characters are: &quot; * / &lt; &gt; ? &nbsp;| also a
space or period if it is the last character of the file
name, character codes 0x01 to 0x1f (control characters) and
Apple&rsquo; apple logo.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
these private Unicode characters are not readable by the
mkisofs NT executable. Therefore any file or directory name
containing these characters will be ignored - including the
contents of any such directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MacOS X AppleDouble</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When HFS/HFS+ files are copied
or saved by MacOS X on to a non-HFS file system (e.g. UFS,
NFS etc.), the files are stored in AppleDouble format. Data
fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
same name prefixed with &quot;._&quot;. Finder info also
stored in same &quot;._&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MacOS X HFS (Alpha)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Not really an Apple/Unix
encoding, but actual HFS/HFS+ files on a MacOS X system.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a pseudo
file with the same name with the suffix &rsquo;/rsrc&rsquo;.
The finderinfo is only available via a MacOS X library
call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Notes: (also
see README.macosx)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Only works when
used on MacOS X.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a file is
found with a zero length resource fork and empty finderinfo,
it is assumed not to have any Apple/Unix encoding -
therefore a TYPE and CREATOR can be set using other
methods.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>mkisofs</i>
will attempt to set the CREATOR, TYPE, date and possibly
other flags from the finder info. Additionally, if it
exists, the Macintosh filename is set from the finder info,
otherwise the Macintosh name is based on the Unix filename -
see the <b>HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES</b> section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
<b>&minus;apple</b> option, the TYPE and CREATOR are stored
in the optional System Use or SUSP field in the ISO-9660
Directory Record - in much the same way as the Rock Ridge
attributes are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple
extensions are added at the beginning of the existing Rock
Ridge attributes (i.e. to get the Apple extensions you get
the Rock Ridge extensions as well).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Apple
extensions require the resource fork to be stored as an
ISO-9660 <i>associated</i> file. This is just like any
normal file stored in the ISO-9660 filesystem except that
the associated file flag is set in the Directory Record (bit
2). This file has the same name as the data fork (the file
seen by non-Apple machines). Associated files are normally
ignored by other OSs</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
<b>&minus;hfs</b> option, the TYPE and CREATOR plus other
finder info, are stored in a separate HFS directory, not
visible on the ISO-9660 volume. The HFS directory references
the same data and resource fork files described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases,
it is better to use the <b>&minus;hfs</b> option instead of
the <b>&minus;apple</b> option, as the latter imposes the
limited ISO-9660 characters allowed in filenames. However,
the Apple extensions do give the advantage that the files
are packed on the disk more efficiently and it may be
possible to fit more files on a CD - important when the
total size of the source files is approaching 650MB.</p>

<h2>HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES
<a name="HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where possible,
the HFS filename that is stored with an Apple/Unix file is
used for the HFS part of the CD. However, not all the
Apple/Unix encodings store the HFS filename with the
finderinfo. In these cases, the Unix filename is used - with
escaped special characters. Special characters include
&rsquo;/&rsquo; and characters with codes over 127.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aufs escapes
these characters by using &quot;:&quot; followed by the
character code as two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare
have a similar scheme, but uses &quot;%&quot; instead of a
&quot;:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If mkisofs
can&rsquo;t find an HFS filename, then it uses the Unix
name, with any %xx or :xx characters (xx == two hex digits)
converted to a single character code. If &quot;xx&quot; are
not hex digits ([0-9a-fA-F]), then they are left alone -
although any remaining &quot;:&quot; is converted to
&quot;%&quot; as colon is the HFS directory separator. Care
must be taken, as an ordinary Unix file with %xx or :xx will
also be converted. e.g.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-17043.png" alt="Image grohtml-17043.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although HFS
filenames appear to support upper and lower case letters,
the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the filenames
&quot;aBc&quot; and &quot;AbC&quot; are the same. If a file
is found in a directory with the same HFS name, then
<i>mkisofs</i> will attempt, where possible, to make a
unique name by adding &rsquo;_&rsquo; characters to one of
the filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an HFS
filename exists for a file, then mkisofs can use this name
as the starting point for the ISO-9660, Joliet and Rock
Ridge filenames using the <b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b>
option. Normal Unix files without an HFS name will still use
their Unix name. e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<i>MacBinary</i> (or <i>PC Exchange</i>) file is stored as
<i>someimage.gif.bin</i> on the Unix filesystem, but
contains a HFS file called <i>someimage.gif</i>, then this
is the name that would appear on the HFS part of the CD.
However, as mkisofs uses the Unix name as the starting point
for the other names, then the ISO-9660 name generated will
probably be <i>SOMEIMAG.BIN</i> and the Joliet/Rock Ridge
would be <i>someimage.gif.bin</i>. Although the actual data
(in this case) is a GIF image. This option will use the HFS
filename as the starting point and the ISO-9660 name will
probably be <i>SOMEIMAG.GIF</i> and the Joliet/Rock Ridge
would be <i>someimage.gif</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using the
<b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b> option will not currently work
with the <b>&minus;T</b> option - the Unix name will be used
in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The character
set used to convert any HFS file name to a Joliet/Rock Ridge
file name defaults to <i>cp10000</i> (Mac Roman). The
character set used can be specified using the
<i>&minus;input&minus;hfs&minus;charset</i> option. Other
built in HFS character sets are: cp10006 (MacGreek), cp10007
(MacCyrillic), cp10029 (MacLatin2), cp10079 (MacIcelandic)
and cp10081 (MacTurkish).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: the
character codes used by HFS file names taken from the
various Apple/Unix formats will not be converted as they are
assumed to be in the correct Apple character set. Only the
Joliet/Rock Ridge names derived from the HFS file names will
be converted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The existing
mkisofs code will filter out any illegal characters for the
ISO-9660 and Joliet filenames, but as mkisofs expects to be
dealing directly with Unix names, it leaves the Rock Ridge
names as is. But as &rsquo;/&rsquo; is a legal HFS filename
character, the <b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b> option converts
&rsquo;/&rsquo; to a &rsquo;_&rsquo; in Rock Ridge
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the Apple
extensions are used, then only the ISO-9660 filenames will
appear on the Macintosh. However, as the Macintosh ISO-9660
drivers can use <i>Level 2</i> filenames, then you can use
options like <b>&minus;allow&minus;multidot</b> without
problems on a Macintosh - still take care over the names,
for example <i>this.file.name</i> will be converted to
<i>THIS.FILE</i> i.e. only have one &rsquo;.&rsquo;, also
filename <i>abcdefgh</i> will be seen as <i>ABCDEFGH</i> but
<i>abcdefghi</i> will be seen as <i>ABCDEFGHI.</i> i.e. with
a &rsquo;.&rsquo; at the end - don&rsquo;t know if this is a
Macintosh problem or mkisofs/mkhybrid problem. All filenames
will be in upper case when viewed on a Macintosh. Of course,
DOS/Win3.X machines will not be able to see Level 2
filenames...</p>

<h2>HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS
<a name="HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To give a HFS
CD a custom icon, make sure the root (top level) folder
includes a standard Macintosh volume icon file. To give a
volume a custom icon on a Macintosh, an icon has to be
pasted over the volume&rsquo;s icon in the &quot;Get
Info&quot; box of the volume. This creates an invisible file
called &rsquo;Icon\r&rsquo; (&rsquo;\r&rsquo; is the
&rsquo;carriage return&rsquo; character) in the root
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A custom folder
icon is very similar - an invisible file called
&rsquo;Icon\r&rsquo; exits in the folder itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Probably the
easiest way to create a custom icon that mkisofs can use, is
to format a blank HFS floppy disk on a Mac, paste an icon to
its &quot;Get Info&quot; box. If using Linux with the HFS
module installed, mount the floppy using something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mount &minus;t
hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The floppy will
be mounted as a CAP file system by default. Then run mkisofs
using something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mkisofs
&minus;&minus;cap &minus;o output source_dir /mnt/floppy</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are not
using Linux, then you can use the hfsutils to copy the icon
file from the floppy. However, care has to be taken, as the
icon file contains a control character. e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hmount /dev/fd0
<br>
hdir &minus;a <br>
hcopy &minus;m Icon^V^M icon_dir/icon</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
&rsquo;^V^M&rsquo; is control&minus;V followed by
control&minus;M. Then run <b>mkisofs</b> by using something
like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mkisofs
&minus;&minus;macbin &minus;o output source_dir icon_dir</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The procedure
for creating/using custom folder icons is very similar -
paste an icon to folder&rsquo;s &quot;Get Info&quot; box and
transfer the resulting &rsquo;Icon\r&rsquo; file to the
relevant directory in the mkisofs source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may want to
hide the icon files from the ISO-9660 and Joliet trees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To give a
custom icon to a Joliet CD, follow the instructions found

<h2>HFS BOOT DRIVER
<a name="HFS BOOT DRIVER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It <i>may</i>
be possible to make the hybrid CD bootable on a
Macintosh.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A bootable HFS
CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or compatible) driver, a
bootable HFS partition and the necessary System, Finder,
etc. files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A driver can be
obtained from any other Macintosh bootable CD-ROM using the
<i>apple_driver</i> utility. This file can then be used with
the <b>&minus;boot&minus;hfs&minus;file</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The HFS
partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case) must contain a
suitable System Folder, again from another CD-ROM or
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a partition
to be bootable, it must have its <i>boot block</i> set. The
boot block is in the first two blocks of a partition. For a
non-bootable partition the boot block is full of zeros.
Normally, when a System file is copied to partition on a
Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a number of
required settings - unfortunately I don&rsquo;t know the
full spec for the boot block, so I&rsquo;m guessing that the
following will work OK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore, the
utility <i>apple_driver</i> also extracts the boot block
from the first HFS partition it finds on the given CD-ROM
and this is used for the HFS partition created by
<b>mkisofs</b>. <br>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mkisofs</b>
may safely be installed suid root. This may be needed to
allow <b>mkisofs</b> to read the previous session when
creating a multi session image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mkisofs</b>
is not based on the standard mk*fs tools for unix, because
we must generate a complete copy of an existing filesystem
on a disk in the ISO-9660 filesystem. The name mkisofs is
probably a bit of a misnomer, since it not only creates the
filesystem, but it also populates it as well. However, the
appropriate tool name for a UNIX tool that creates populated
filesystems - <b>mkproto</b> - is not well known.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>mkisofs</b> is creating a filesystem image with Rock
Ridge attributes and the directory nesting level of the
source directory tree is too much for ISO-9660,
<b>mkisofs</b> will do deep directory relocation. This
results in a directory called <b>RR_MOVED</b> in the root
directory of the CD. You cannot avoid this directory in the
directory tree that is visible with ISO-9660 but it it
automatically hidden in the <b>Rock Ridge</b> tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sparc boot
support that is implemented with the
<b>&minus;sparc&minus;boot</b> options completely follows
the official Sparc CD boot requirements from the Boot prom
in Sun Sparc systems. Some Linux distributions for Sparc
systems use a boot loader called <b>SILO</b> that
unfortunately is not Sparc CD boot compliant. It is
annoyingly to see that the Authors of SILO don&rsquo;t fix
SILO but instead provide a completely unneeded
&quot;patch&quot; to mkisofs that incorporates far more
source than the fix for SILO would need.</p>

<h2>HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS
<a name="HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I have had to
make several assumptions on how I expect the modified libhfs
routines to work, however there may be situations that
either I haven&rsquo;t thought of, or come across when these
assumptions fail. Therefore I can&rsquo;t guarantee that
mkisofs will work as expected (although I haven&rsquo;t had
a major problem yet). Most of the HFS features work fine,
however, some are not fully tested. These are marked as
<i>Alpha</i> above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although HFS
filenames appear to support upper and lower case letters,
the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the filenames
&quot;aBc&quot; and &quot;AbC&quot; are the same. If a file
is found in a directory with the same HFS name, then
<i>mkisofs</i> will attempt, where possible, to make a
unique name by adding &rsquo;_&rsquo; characters to one of
the filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HFS
file/directory names that share the first 31 characters have
_N&rsquo; (N == decimal number) substituted for the last few
characters to generate unique names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Care must be
taken when &quot;grafting&quot; Apple/Unix files or
directories (see above for the method and syntax involved).
It is not possible to use a new name for an Apple/Unix
encoded file/directory. e.g. If a Apple/Unix encoded file
called &quot;oldname&quot; is to added to the CD, then you
can not use the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">mkisofs
&minus;o output.raw &minus;hfs &minus;graft&minus;points
newname=oldname cd_dir</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mkisofs will be
unable to decode &quot;oldname&quot;. However, you can graft
Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long as you do
not attempt to give them new names as above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When creating
an HFS volume with the multisession options, <b>&minus;M</b>
and <b>&minus;C</b>, only files in the last session will be
in the HFS volume. i.e. mkisofs can not <i>add</i> existing
files from previous sessions to the HFS volume.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if
each session is created with the <b>&minus;part</b> option,
then each session will appear as separate volumes when
mounted on a Mac. In this case, it is worth using the
<b>&minus;V</b> or <b>&minus;hfs&minus;volid</b> option to
give each session a unique volume name, otherwise each
&quot;volume&quot; will appear on the Desktop with the same
name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Symbolic links
(as with all other non-regular files) are not added to the
HFS directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hybrid volumes
may be larger than pure ISO-9660 volumes containing the same
data. In some cases (e.g. DVD sized volumes) the hybrid
volume may be significantly larger. As an HFS volume gets
bigger, so does the allocation block size (the smallest
amount of space a file can occupy). For a 650Mb CD, the
allocation block is 10Kb, for a 4.7Gb DVD it will be about
70Kb.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The maximum
number of files in an HFS volume is about 65500 - although
the real limit will be somewhat less than this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The resulting
hybrid volume can be accessed on a Unix machine by using the
hfsutils routines. However, no changes can be made to the
volume as it is set as <b>locked.</b> The option
<b>&minus;hfs&minus;unlock</b> will create an output image
that is unlocked - however no changes should be made to the
contents of the volume (unless you really know what you are
doing) as it&rsquo;s not a &quot;real&quot; HFS volume.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using the
<b>&minus;mac&minus;name</b> option will not currently work
with the <b>&minus;T</b> option - the Unix name will be used
in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although
<b>mkisofs</b> does not alter the contents of a file, if a
binary file has its TYPE set as &rsquo;TEXT&rsquo;, it
<i>may</i> be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a
better choice for the default TYPE may be
&rsquo;????&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;mac&minus;boot&minus;file</b> option may not work
at all...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">May not work
with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS
8.1). DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be
mounted as type <b>msdos</b> (not <b>vfat</b>) when using
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SFM format
is only partially supported - see <b>HFS MACINTOSH FILE
FORMATS</b> section above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
possible to use the the <b>&minus;sparc&minus;boot</b> or
<b>&minus;generic&minus;boot</b> options with the
<b>&minus;boot&minus;hfs&minus;file</b> the
<b>&minus;prep&minus;boot</b> or
<b>&minus;chrp&minus;boot</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mkisofs</b>
should be able to create HFS hybrid images over 4Gb,
although this has not been fully tested.</p>
