Or how to build from Linux an isohybrid image bootable from BIOS or UEFI.

> *An ISO image is an archive file of an optical disc, a type of disk image composed of the data contents from every written sector on an optical disc, including the optical disc file system. ISO image files usually have a file extension of .iso. The name ISO is taken from the ISO 9660 file system used with CD-ROM media, but what is known as an ISO image might also contain a UDF (ISO/IEC 13346) file system (commonly used by DVDs and Blu-ray Discs).* [»](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image)

> *The isohybrid feature enhances ISO 9660 file system by a Master Boot Record (MBR) for booting via BIOS from disk storage devices like USB flash drives.* [»](http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid)
